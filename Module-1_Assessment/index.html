      <p>My name is John Baltz and I am 23 years old. I graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor`s of Science in Biomedical Engineering.

      <p>I have many hobbies which I pursue during the free time that I have - which isn't always a lot. I like playing video games, but I also like spending time outside. I like to go on hikes and try new trails and I am trying to learn to like running. Sport are another hobby that I am passionate about - football in particular.</p>

    <p>My family is also important to me. I have an almost wife and two kids (cats). The girl is named Danielle and the cats are named Ellie (2 years old) and Charlie (1 year old). Eventually I would like to expand on my family with another member - maybe a dog.</p>
